This document is a reference manual for all the scripting commands and functions
available in rAthena.

It is not a simple tutorial. When people tell you to **"Read The F\*\*\*ing Manual"**, they mean this.

This is not a place to teach you basic programming. This document will not teach
you basic programming by itself. It's more of a reference for those who have at
least a vague idea of what they want to do and want to know what tools they have
available to do it. We`ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you
don't understand it, getting a clear book on programming in general will help
better than yelling around the forum for help.

A little learning never caused anyone`s head to explode.
