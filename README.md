# Welcome to User-Guides
A collection of user-submitted guides in markdown format, for both easy-reading and for automated generation via mkdocs.

The files inside `/guides/` are automatically generated by some fantastic software called MkDocs. MkDocs is a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Each time a commit is pushed to the master branch, the site is automatically rebuilt and deployed to GitHub Pages by a Github Action. You can view the generated site at [https://rathena.github.io/user-guides/](https://rathena.github.io/user-guides/).
